# WSO2 Identity Server — Daon TrustX Identity Provider (IDP) Connector

This connector integrates [Daon TrustX](https://www.daon.com/trustx/) into WSO2 Identity Server as a
**federated OIDC connection**, using the custom `DaonAuthenticator` (login) and `DaonExecutor` (flow)
pair. It ships **two connection templates**, both of the same `DaonAuthenticator` type:

- **Daon Identity Verifier** (the *enrol* connection) — **self-contained**: holds its own
  OIDC client credentials, endpoints, scopes and the **enrol process definition**. Add it to
  registration and invited-user flows to enrol and verify users. It anchors the Daon **federated
  association** (verification state) under its own connection name.
- **Daon TrustX Authenticator** (the *login* connection) — **references** an Identity Verifier
  connection by resource id (`daon_idp_id`) and holds a **login process definition**. Add it to an
  application's login flow (re-verify an enrolled user) and to password-recovery. It resolves OIDC
  credentials/endpoints from, and shares the enrolment association of, the referenced Identity
  Verification connection — so **multiple login connections can share one enrolment**.

The flows:

- **Self-registration** — provision a new user's profile from Daon-verified claims (first-time enrolment).
- **Invited-user registration** — have Daon validate the pre-populated profile against the identity document (step fails on mismatch).
- **Login verification** — as a login step, re-verify an already-enrolled user. A user not yet enrolled
  with Daon fails with an error (enrolment happens via a registration flow, not at login).
- **Password-recovery verification** — face / push notification based re-verification of an already-enrolled user.

A connection is *self-contained* (no `daon_idp_id`) or *referencing* (`daon_idp_id` set) — the runtime
branches on that to read OIDC config and the association key either from the connection's own props or
from the referenced Identity Verifier connection. The relevant **process definition** (enrol PD for
registration/invited-user, login PD for login/recovery) is sent as `acr_values`
(`<ProcessDefinitionName:Version>`); enrolment additionally requests `verified_claims`, while login and
password recovery re-verify with a `login_hint` (the Daon `preferred_username`). The verification state
is stored as a **federated identity association** (local user ↔ Daon subject) in IS's built-in
association store — no custom user claims and no separate Identity Verification Provider (IDVP) resource.

## Prerequisites

- WSO2 Identity Server 7.x
- Maven 3.6+
- JDK 21
- A Daon TrustX tenant with admin access

---

## Building

```bash
mvn clean install
```

Artifacts produced (a single OSGi bundle — **no WAR**):

| Artifact | Location |
|---|---|
| Connector bundle (authenticator + executor + listener) | `components/org.wso2.carbon.identity.verification.daon.connector/target/org.wso2.carbon.identity.verification.daon.connector-*.jar` |
| Release archive (bundle + connection templates + setup script) | `components/org.wso2.carbon.identity.verification.daon.connector/target/wso2is-daon-connector-*.zip` |

---

## Deployment

### 1. Copy artifacts to WSO2 IS

Use the release archive (recommended). Extract it inside `<IS_HOME>`, change into the extracted
directory and run the setup script — it moves the bundle into `dropins` and both connection templates
into the connection-extensions directory:

```bash
IS_HOME=/path/to/wso2is

unzip wso2is-daon-connector-*.zip -d $IS_HOME
cd $IS_HOME/wso2is-daon-connector-*
./setup_daon.sh
```

Or place the artifacts by hand:

```bash
IS_HOME=/path/to/wso2is
C=components/org.wso2.carbon.identity.verification.daon.connector

# OSGi bundle
cp $C/target/org.wso2.carbon.identity.verification.daon.connector-*.jar \
$IS_HOME/repository/components/dropins/

# Both Daon TrustX connection templates
cp -r $C/resources/daon-idv $C/resources/daon-authenticator \
$IS_HOME/repository/resources/identity/extensions/identity-providers/

# Daon logo
cp $C/resources/assets/images/logos/daon.svg \
$IS_HOME/repository/deployment/server/webapps/console/resources/connections/assets/images/logos/
```

> Both templates are `identity-provider` resources, so they go under
> `resources/identity/extensions/identity-providers/`. The exact path can vary by IS version — place
> `daon-idv` (enrol) and `daon-authenticator` (login) where your IS build reads connection templates.

> **Upgrading from an earlier build?** The authenticator and connector bundles have been consolidated
> into the single `org.wso2.carbon.identity.verification.daon.connector` bundle. Delete any previously
> deployed `org.wso2.carbon.identity.verification.daon.authenticator-*.jar` from `dropins` before
> restarting — leaving it there registers a second authenticator/executor/listener and exports the
> packages that have since moved. No connection reconfiguration is needed: the authenticator name
> (`DaonAuthenticator`), the executor name (`DaonExecutor`) and both connection templates are unchanged.

### 2. No custom claims to register

Verification state is stored as a **federated identity association** (via the built-in
`FederatedAssociationManager`, in the `IDP_USER_ID` store) — the presence of an association with the
Daon IDP means "verified", and the association's federated user id holds the Daon `preferred_username`
used for `login_hint`. Nothing to register.

### 3. Restart WSO2 IS

```bash
$IS_HOME/bin/wso2server.sh restart
```

## Registering an OIDC Client in Daon TrustX

1. Log in to your Daon TrustX administration console.
2. Create a **Confidential** OIDC client.
3. Add the IS `/commonauth` endpoint (login) and your registration portal callback as allowed redirect
   URIs. The exact authorized redirect URI is shown on the connection's **Settings** tab after creation.
4. Enable the required scopes: `openid`, `profile`, `document`.
5. Note the **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and the **authorization** and **token** endpoint URLs.
6. Note the **enrol process definition** (registration/invited-user) and the **login process
   definition** (login/recovery re-verification) to use.

---

## Configuring the Connection in WSO2 IS

### Step 1 — Create the Daon Identity Verifier (enrol) connection

1. Console → **Connections** → **New Connection** → **Daon Identity Verifier**.
2. Fill in the create form:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name** | e.g. `Daon Identity Verifier` |
| **Client ID** / **Client Secret** | From the Daon OIDC client |
| **Authorization Endpoint URL** / **Token Endpoint URL** | Daon OIDC endpoints |
| **Scopes** | `openid profile document` |
| **Enrol Process Definition** | PD for registration/invited-user enrolment, `<Name:Version>` |

3. On the **Settings** tab, copy the **Authorized redirect URI** and register it on the Daon OIDC client.
   The login connection created in Step 2 picks this connection from a drop-down — nothing to copy.

### Step 2 — Create the Daon TrustX Authenticator (login) connection

1. Console → **Connections** → **New Connection** → **Daon TrustX Authenticator**.
2. Fill in the create form:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name** | e.g. `Daon TrustX Login` |
| **Daon Identity Verifier** | Pick the Identity Verifier connection from Step 1 in the drop-down |
| **Login Process Definition** | PD for login/recovery re-verification, `<Name:Version>` |

> The **Daon Identity Verifier** drop-down lists only the Daon Identity Verifier connections of the
> organization and stores the selected connection's resource ID in `daon_idp_id`. It needs a console
> built from the patched `identity-apps` fork (the `select` field type plus the `optionsSource`
> resolver); on a stock console the field falls back to a free-text box where the resource ID
> (shown in the connection details / console URL) has to be pasted.

You can create several login connections (e.g. per application, with different login PDs) all
referencing the same Identity Verifier connection; they share one enrolment.

### Step 3 — Map attributes

On the **Identity Verifier** connection's **Attributes** tab, map Daon claim names to WSO2 local
claims (these drive verification):

| WSO2 Local Claim | Daon Claim Name |
|---|---|
| `http://wso2.org/claims/givenname` | `given_name` |
| `http://wso2.org/claims/lastname` | `family_name` |
| `http://wso2.org/claims/dob` | `birthdate` |

Add mappings for any additional claims your Daon tenant returns. When Daon returns a combined
`family_name_and_given_name` field instead of split names, the executor splits it on `^`
(`<family>^<given>`, the ICAO 9303 MRZ order: surname first).

### Step 4 — Add Daon to your flows

Add the **Identity Verifier** connection to enrolment flows and a **Authenticator** (login)
connection to login/recovery:

- **Self-registration**: add the **Daon Identity Verifier** connection's executor node to the
  registration flow. It requests `verified_claims`, provisions the profile from the verified claims, and
  records a federated association (⇒ verified). Sends the **enrol PD** as `acr_values`.
- **Invited-user registration**: add the **Daon Identity Verifier** connection's executor node
  to the invited-user flow **before the set-password step**. When the invited user clicks the magic link
  / enters the OTP, they are redirected to Daon to verify the claims the admin defined. Every mapped
  claim the admin set on the user (read from the flow user, falling back to the user store by user id) is
  sent to Daon as an OIDC claim **value-request**, so *Daon* compares them against the identity document.
  A mismatch comes back as a `CLAIMS_VERIFICATION_MISMATCH` error on the callback and the step fails with
  `DAON-60003`; the connector does no client-side re-validation of the returned claims. **Only a
  successful verification advances to set-password.** If none of the mapped-and-populated attributes is
  document-verifiable, the step fails with `DAON-65023` rather than accepting a verification that proves
  nothing about the profile. On success a federated association is recorded (⇒ verified). Sends the
  **enrol PD**.
- **Login**: add a **Daon TrustX Authenticator** (login) connection to an application's Login Flow as a
  step **after** the user is identified (e.g. after username/password). The user must already be enrolled
  with Daon (have an association with the referenced Identity Verifier connection); the step
  re-verifies them with a `login_hint` (the Daon `preferred_username` from the association) and the
  **login PD**. A user with no Daon association is not enrolled and the login step **fails with an
  error** — enrolment happens via a registration flow.
- **Password recovery**: add a **Daon TrustX Authenticator** (login) connection; its executor node
  re-verifies with a `login_hint` and the **login PD**. A user with no Daon association fails with an
  error.

## Runtime Behaviour

```
   enrol PD (IdV connection) for enrolment; login PD (login connection) for login/recovery — as acr_values
  ┌──────────────────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Flow                     │ PD sent      │ Behaviour                                    │
  ├──────────────────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Self-registration        │ enrol PD     │ verified_claims → provision profile, assoc   │
  │ Invited-user registration│ enrol PD     │ verified_claims → validate profile, assoc    │
  │ Login (enrolled)         │ login PD     │ login_hint (re-verify)                       │
  │ Login (not enrolled)     │ —            │ error — enrol via a registration flow first  │
  │ Password recovery        │ login PD     │ login_hint (re-verify); error if not enrolled│
  └──────────────────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Profile attributes come from the ID token's `verifiedClaims.claims`; the verified state itself is a
federated association (local user ↔ Daon subject), not a user claim.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Redirect to Daon fails / missing endpoint | Authorization/token endpoint blank on the connection | Set the OIDC endpoint URLs on the **Settings** tab |
| `401` on token exchange | Wrong `Client ID` / `Client Secret` | Verify credentials match the Daon OIDC client |
| `401` on token exchange with correct credentials | Daon client requires HTTP Basic client authentication; the OIDC authenticator/executor send the credentials in the request body by default | Set the `IsBasicAuthEnabled` authenticator property to `true` on the connection (management API) |
| No `acr_values` sent | Process definition not configured | Set the enrol PD on the Identity Verifier connection (enrolment) or the login PD on the login connection (login/recovery) |
| Enrolment runs plain OIDC (no Daon verification) | An old stock-OIDC IdP connection was added to the enrolment flow | Use a **Daon Identity Verifier** connection — only a `DaonAuthenticator`-type connection binds `DaonExecutor` |
| Login "not enrolled" for a user enrolled elsewhere | Login connection's **Daon Identity Verifier** points at a different Identity Verifier connection than the one used to enrol | Point all connections at the same Identity Verifier connection (they share its association) |
| Login/recovery fails with "not enrolled with Daon" | User has no Daon association (never enrolled via registration, or `FederatedAssociationManager` unavailable) | Enrol the user through a Daon registration flow first; confirm Daon runs after user identification |
| Verified attributes not provisioned | Attribute mapping missing on the connection | Add the mapping on the **Attributes** tab |
| Names swapped | Daon emits `<family>^<given>` order | Adjust the split order in `DaonExecutor#populateNameClaims` |
| Redirect URI mismatch in Daon | Registered `redirect_uri` differs | Use the exact Authorized redirect URI from the **Settings** tab |
